## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Koray. Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer and cloud & homelab enthusiast. This is my first blog post, and itâ€™s a personal one. You can find out more about me [here](/about).

## Shifting gears, staying sharp

Iâ€™ve been in tech since the late 2000s. Over the years, Iâ€™ve written production systems, led engineering teams, and helped companies launch and evolve their platforms with better architecture and engineering practices.

After relocating across continents (for the second time) and spending meaningful time with family, I took a step back from full-time roles in 2023. I never lost touch with the work. I kept close to the tech, stayed in the loop with peers, and occasionally contributed where I could but more recently, I decided to lean back in.

Iâ€™ve been reconnecting with people in my network, jumping into architecture conversations and picking up side projects I hadnâ€™t had time for while managing teams. I even started a homelab. It's nothing fancy, just a modest rack that lives in our living room, but itâ€™s been the perfect playground to stay sharp.

Along the way, I started dipping back into the job market. Most conversations were good, but one bit of feedback really stuck with me:

> "â€¦despite your extensive expertise and passing all technical challenges, weâ€™ve decided to move forward with someone **currently engaged in hands-on development**."  
> *â€” Engineering Manager role (0â€“10% hands-on ðŸ¤”)*

That one hit harder than I expected. Not because it was unfair but because it felt true. Talking about your projects outside of the experiences listed on your resume is like claiming you can run a marathon but showing up without any shoes. It doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you canâ€™t run, but something about it just feels off.

And then there were the silent rejections, the ones that probably didnâ€™t even make it past the ATS [(Applicant Tracking System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system). ðŸ˜‚

That mix of honest feedback, sometimes getting ghosted by recruiters and market signals made one thing clear: whether you're active or not, if your work isn't visible, it might as well not exist.

That was the nudge. I didnâ€™t need a title to stay in the game. I just needed a space to **build**, **reflect**, and **share**.

## Keep it simple, make it visible

So I started KryWorks. Itâ€™s not a company or a startup, just a personal space where I document what Iâ€™m working on, what Iâ€™m learning (or breaking ðŸ¤¯), and how Iâ€™m staying active in the field.

These days, Iâ€™m helping friends and former teammates with cloud infrastructure (AWS), DevOps setups, and architecture reviews. 

Iâ€™m also experimenting with things like GitOps, Kubernetes, hybrid cloud setups, and self-hosted tools in my homelab. Itâ€™s a little messy and always a work in progress, but itâ€™s real.

The blog? It's mostly an intro for now. But over time, Iâ€™ll use it to:

- Share take aways from the projects
- Capture experiments from the homelab
- Learn in public, stay sharp, and maybe help others along the way

Writing and sharing like this is something Iâ€™ve wanted to do for years, but I always put it off. I knew that there were already enough smart voices out there and whatâ€™s one more blog going to do? But eventually, I realized the answer was simple:

Why not?

Even if no one reads it, at the very least Iâ€™ll have built a living playbook I can revisit later. And if someone finds it helpful? Thatâ€™s a bonus.

If you're on a similar path whether you're actively building or just figuring out your next step, feel free to follow along. Iâ€™ll be sharing the ride.

Thanks for reading.

Cheers,   
**â€” Koray**
