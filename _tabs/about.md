## 👋 Hey, 

My name is Koray. I'm a full stack software engineer and homelab & cloud enthusiast.

I’ve been in tech since the late 2000s, working across software engineering, architecture, and team leadership. 

After a career pause to focus on family (and a couple of cross-continent moves), I found myself navigating today’s job market, complete with polite automated rejections and long interview cycles. Somewhere along the way, I realized I didn’t want to wait around for someone else’s “yes” before building again.

So I started **KryWorks** — part digital garden, part lab notebook, part playground to stay sharp and hands-on.

These days, I’m:
- Consulting for folks in my network  
- Building (and breaking) things in a low-cost, low-noise homelab (fully wife-approved 💪)
- Exploring containerization, GitOps, self-hosting, and offloading parts of the stack to AWS when it makes sense technically (and financially 💰)

This blog is my way of learning in public — experiments, takeaways, a few mistakes, and hopefully some useful ideas for others doing the same.

Not trying to be an influencer, just a builder figuring things out and sharing the journey.

If any of this sounds familiar, feel free to follow along or reach out.
