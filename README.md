# KryWorks Blog

Welcome to **KryWorks** blog, my personal digital space where I document my journey through DevOps, software engineering, homelab tinkering, and everything in between.

This blog isn’t meant to be polished or perfect. It’s a place to share real-world lessons, side projects, experiments, and the occasional failure along the way. I’m keeping things visible, hands-on, and hopefully useful to others walking a similar path.

### What You'll Find Here

- Write-ups from homelab experiments (Kubernetes, GitOps, Terraform, self-hosting, etc.)
- Notes from consulting on cloud cost optimization and modern DevOps practices
- Architecture thoughts, tooling tips, and engineering insights
- Occasional rants, reflections, and real talk about tech careers

### Built With

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - static site generatoras the static site  & 
- [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) Jekyll theme

### Follow Along

The blog is just getting started. If you're into DevOps, full-stack engineering, or just building things in public, feel free to follow along or reach out.

Cheers,
